# OpenWear Module

![alt text](/img/image.png)

## Overview

Currently, the OpenWear toolkit contains 11 modules, which are:

- Gyroscope module
- Gesture recognition module
- Distance module
- Tilt module
- Touch module
- LED module
- RGB module
- Buzzer module
- Vibration module
- Battery module
- Prototype breadboard

These modules are widely used in wearable projects. If you have requests for other modules, you can submit your issue on the [Github](https://github.com/openwearxyz/openwear/issues) page, or you can download the EDA files from [this page](https://github.com/openwearxyz/openwear/tree/main/hardware/PCB), where we provide design templates for the corresponding modules.

## Technical Details

The module also adopts a circular PCB design with a diameter of 5 cm. All modules have 6 pins, each marked with the corresponding pin name. Generally, they can be divided into two types: one that only requires connections for power and ground, and another that, in addition to power and ground, requires one or two signal pins.

The bottom of the module is glued with a magnet for quick attachment to clothing, and corresponding magnetic fixation clips can be easily purchased online, such as [this one](https://amzn.asia/d/8wcJzql).
